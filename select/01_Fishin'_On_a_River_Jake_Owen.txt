I had already stopped by the bait shop
Filled up the cooler and the tank
And the tackle box
Weatherman calling for cloudy and eighty -two
Sundown it's a full moon
I had my old red ragger all shined up
My good rods and a better day
Lined up I was ready to go
And it turned out she was too

So now I'm sitting in a bar
Instead of fishin' on a river
Wetting my whistle
Instead of wetting my line
Catching me a bazz
Not catching me a bass
Running up the tab
Instead of that Mercur twenty- five
I don't know where it all went wrong
But all I know is that girl's gone
And a honey hole ain't gonna
Help me forget her
So I'm sitting in a bar
Instead of fishin' on a river

Had already made up her goodbye mind
Took her things left me nothing
But them tail lights
They say the neon and the jukebox
Helps the leaving
And that's the reason that I'm
Sitting in a bar
Instead of fishing on a river

Wetting my whistle
Instead of wetting my line
Catching me a bazz
Not catching me a bass
Running up the tab
Instead of that Mercury twenty- five
I don't know where it went wrong
But all I know is that girl's gone
And a honey hole ain't gonna
Help me forget her
So I'm sitting in a bar
Instead of fishin' on a river

I outta be tired of throwing them back by now
But here I am letting her go
Throwing them back right now
Sitting in a bar
Instead of fishin' on a river
Sitting in a bar
Instead of fishin' on a river
(Wishing I was her)
Sitting in the bar
Instead of fishing on a river
Wetting my whistle
Instead of wetting my line
Catching me a bazz
Instead of catching me a bass
Running up the bath tab
Instead of that Mercury twenty-five

I don't know where it all went wrong
But all i know is that girl's gone
And a honey hole ain't gonna
Help me forget her
So i'm sitting at a bar
Instead of fishin' on a river

I should be fishin' on a river
